# Cryptocurrency_Arbitrage_Analysis

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is the scenario that I am an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of my department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, I must determine if we can capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas.

I will sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. I will apply the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin. Specifically, I will select time periods in which to identify arbitrage opportunities.

I will create a Jupyter notebook that contains the code for my data collection, preparation, and analysis, including any visualizations.
